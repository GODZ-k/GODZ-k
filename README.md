2. **Django Hotel App**
   - Creating a user authentication Hotel app in Django involves building a web application that allows users to Search the hotels with their requirements. This app has a filtration system that users can find the hotel based on category. This is a fundamental part of many web applications, especially those that require user registration, login, and management.
