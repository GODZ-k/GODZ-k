## 🌟 Projects

Here are a few projects I've worked on:

1. **Django CRUD App**
   - We used Django and functional based views to develop a simple CRUD application to allow one to create a new task, Read task, update a task and delete a task. we used a postgresql 
     database in this CRUD App. we can check the App data on Railway.app.

2. **Django Advance Authentication CRUD Recipe App**
   - Creating a user authentication CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app in Django involves building a web application that allows users to perform these four basic operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user accounts. This is a fundamental part of many web applications, especially those that require user registration, login, and management.
